            <p>So, you've found my blog. I am not sure how I feel about that, considering the amount of trouble I have had making the website function. Considering the low likelihood that it will... continue to function... Anyway, do be greeted anyhow! In this place, at supposedly haphazard times and according to my truest desires, I might be sharing some of my jazz-related musings. I am not under the illusion that anyone or their mum will find this page, let alone find anything here interesting. It often seems to be the way with musings shared, that they seem much more interesting before being shared, than after. </p>

<p>Where did this idea come from? Over the last year or so, I seem to have amassed a considerably larger collection of jazz music in my streaming library than I find comfortable for personal use. That is, I have spent too. Much. Time. Cataloguing music for the benefits of that work not to be seen by anyone but myself! That’s not to say I have much of value to say about the music, or that my little library is any bigger than anyone else’s, or anything like that though. Don’t feel threatened by me.  </p>

<p>What kind of jazz, though? I will be direct and tell you I am into lindy hop in a big way. Which means, of course, that I have a certain bias toward music that you can dance to. That’s also where I am “coming from” in my jazz journey, you could say – as opposed to someone who has played a lot of jazz themselves, or someone who has inherited a massive CD collection from their ancestors. But I do love a lot of music that you can’t really dance to, if you believe in that kind of distinction, that is. </p>

<p>Hopefully, you will discover something that will make you a little bit happier for a little bit of time. That would be awesome. Maybe I could learn something from you, too? </p>

<p>Finally, I will share something music-related to kick this journey off. It’s going to be a statement. <i>Blue Moon</i> by Billie Holiday is, and I will not take any arguments against it, the definitive best lindy hop tune. My opinion is correct, and unless you can prove me wrong by providing a concrete example of a better one, I will stand by it, as all of the other hundreds of songs in my library pale in comparison to <i>Blue Moon</i>. No, you can’t tell me it’s too mainstream, that doesn’t weaken my claim, I already know that. According to the 
<a href="http://sortyourmusic.playlistmachinery.com">Sort Your Music</a> tool, it is the most popular of all the songs I have in my monster playlist, and I love it no less for that. Then again, I may just not have heard it enough to be sick of it yet. What a blessing, I say! At a perfect tempo for comfortable dancing at 125 bpm, with its sweet piano rhythms it gives off a feeling that it could be the very last song they play for the night and everything is just alright. </p>
